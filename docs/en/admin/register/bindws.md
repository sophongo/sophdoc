# Binding a Workspace for the User

After a user successfully registers, a workspace needs to be bound to them.

## Prerequisites

- AI platform installed
- [User has successfully registered](index.md)
- An available administrator account

## Steps to Follow

1. Log in to the AI platform as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Global Management** -> **Workspace and Folder**, and click **Create Workspace**.

3. Enter the workspace name, select a folder, and click **OK** to create a workspace.


4. Bind resources to the workspace.


    On this interface, you can click **Create Namespace** to create a namespace.
