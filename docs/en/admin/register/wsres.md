# Allocate Resources to the Workspace

After [binding a user to a workspace](./bindws.md), it is necessary to allocate appropriate resources to the workspace.

## Prerequisites

- The AI platform is installed
- An available administrator account
- The workspace has been created and bound to a namespace

## Steps

1. Log in to the AI platform as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Global Management** -> **Workspace and Folder**, find the workspace to which you want to add resources, and click **Add Shared Resources**.


3. Select the cluster, set the appropriate resource quota, and then click **OK**  <a id="quota" />


4. Return to the shared resources page. Resources have been successfully allocated to the workspace, and the administrator can modify them at any time using the **â”‡** on the right side.
