# Delete/Remove Clusters

Clusters created in AI platform [Container Management](../../intro/index.md) can be either deleted or removed. Clusters integrated into AI platform can only be removed.

!!! Info

    If you want to delete an integrated cluster, you should delete it in the platform where it is created.

In AI platform, the difference between __Delete__ and __Remove__ is:

- __Delete__ will destroy the cluster and reset the data of all nodes under the cluster. All data will be totally cleared and lost. Making a backup before deleting a cluster is a recommended best practice. You can no longer use that cluster anymore.
- __Remove__ just removes the cluster from AI platform. It will not destroy the cluster and no data will be lost. You can still use the cluster in other platforms or re-integrate it into AI platform later if needed.

!!! note

    - You should have [Admin](../../../ghippo/user-guide/access-control/role.md)
      or [Kpanda Owner](../../../ghippo/user-guide/access-control/global.md) permissions
      to perform delete or remove operations.
    - Before deleting a cluster, you should turn off __Cluster Deletion Protection__ in
      __Cluster Settings__ -> __Advanced Settings__ , otherwise the __Delete Cluster__ option will not be displayed.
    - The __global service cluster__ cannot be deleted or removed.

1. Enter the Container Management module, find your target cluster, click __ ...__ on the right,
   and select __Delete cluster__ / __Remove__ in the drop-down list.
