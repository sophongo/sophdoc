# shared StorageClass

The AI platform container management module supports sharing a StorageClass with multiple namespaces to improve resource utilization efficiency.

1. Find the StorageClass that needs to be shared in the StorageClass list, and click __Authorize Namespace__ under the operation bar on the right.

    

2. Click __Custom Namespace__ to select which namespaces this StorageClass needs to be shared to one by one.

    - Click __Authorize All Namespaces__ to share this StorageClass to all namespaces under the current cluster at one time.
    - Click __Remove Authorization__ under the operation bar on the right side of the list to deauthorize and stop sharing this StorageClass to this namespace.
