# Configure Notification Server

Insight supports SMS notifications and currently sends alert messages using integrated Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud SMS services. This article explains how to configure the SMS notification server in Insight. The variables supported in the SMS signature are the default variables in the message template. As the number of SMS characters is limited, it is recommended to choose more explicit variables.

> For information on how to configure SMS recipients, refer to the document: [Configure SMS Notification Group](../../user-guide/alert-center/message.md).
