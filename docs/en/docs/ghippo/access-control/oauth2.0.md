# OAuth 2.0 - WeCom

If all members in your enterprise or organization are managed in WeCom, you can use the
identity provider feature based on the OAuth 2.0 protocol provided by Global Management,
without the need to create a username/password for each organization member in AI platform.
You can grant these external user identities permission to use AI platform resources.

## Steps

1. Log in to AI platform with a user who has the **admin** role. Click
   **Global Management** -> **Access Control** at the bottom of the left navigation bar.
